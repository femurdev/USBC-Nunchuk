## 10/15/2025 - Idiazation & proof of concept  

Had to find an old nunchuk to see what it actually had on it. It has two buttons and a joystick (two potentiometers). I recreated it in tinkercad and threw together some quick code for it. The image is below.

I already have all of these components from a birthday present, so I don't need funding on this one.
