This is my journal of the design and building process of **USBC Nunchuck**.

## 10/15/2025 - Idiazation & proof of concept  

Had to find an old nunchuk to see what it actually had on it. It has two buttons and a joystick (two potentiometers). I recreated it in tinkercad and threw together some quick code for it. The image is below.

I already have all of these components from a birthday present, so I don't need funding on this one.  

## 10/18/2025 - BOM and other things  

Copied some 3d scans into blender, then brushed up some things. I sketched some basic printouts and buttons, I don't intend for this thing to be glamorous, just functional. I got my supplies together today. They include:

- 1 of those joy cons that break constantly
- 1 LED
- Resistors for that LED
- 2 buttons from an old mouse

I took the measurements, then threw them out the window and eyeballed it. I don't have a ton of time, so I just gunned it to the finish line for the CAD design phase.
Here's what I have:

## 10/19/2025 8 AM - Fabed and Finished

### Fab
I printed the left half on an X1, hot glued in the buttons & joy stick into position, put the 3d printed buttons into place, ran a USBC cable out the back, then glued the right half onto it.
### Code
I wrote some code, now it is finished. Not much else to say, it works like a charm except if I redid it I would have used actual buttons. There's got to be a better way.
Other than that, I printed, designed, and coded it. My ADHD won't allow me to revisit this for a bit. Everything just kinda worked. Don't ask me to take it apart, there's too much glue!
### Function
I can press on both the Z and C buttons to change it into a pointer controller for my computer. The other mode is a wasd controller for games and stuff. Pressing the joy stick jumps and z and c are left and right click respectively.  

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Slight Recode  

I recorded some things in a second CPP file that is now on the repo, go check it out! Please leave feedback or email me at femurdev@gmail.com if you make one of these! You van make one with an Arduino micro, a USB Cable, hot glue, and one of the generic kits like the one below:
