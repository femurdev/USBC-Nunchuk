## 10/15/2025 - Idiazation & proof of concept  

Had to find an old nunchuk to see what it actually had on it. It has two buttons and a joystick (two potentiometers). I recreated it in tinkercad and threw together some quick code for it. The image is below.

- 1 of those joy cons that break constantly
- 1 LED
- Resistors for that LED
- 2 buttons from an old mouse

I took the measurements, then threw them out the window and eyeballed it. I don't have a ton of time, so I just gunned it to the finish line for the CAD design phase.
Here's what I have:
